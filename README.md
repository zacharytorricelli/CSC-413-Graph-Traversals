# CSC-413-Graph-Traversals
This repository traverses a graph using a BFS and DFS
Implement both BFS and DFS algorithms.

1. You can choose either adjacency lists or adjacency matrix to represent your graphs.
2. Your graph can be hard-coded.
3. Your input graphs can be either undirected or directed.
4. In BFS, you can specify the source vertex by yourself.
5. Implement and test both BFS and DFS algorithms to solve the graph-searching problem.
6. You may use the following graph as your test example. You can also use your own graph and draw it in your report.
